mission: >
  To design and engineer intelligent, adaptable, and elegantly built systems — blending software, data,
  and creative technology into experiences that are efficient, expressive, and human-centered.

experience:
  - company: "MIT Lincoln Laboratory"
    location: "Lexington, MA"
    title: "Software Engineer, Associate Staff"
    dates: "April 2019 – August 2025"
    summary: >
      Developed full-stack geospatial and decision-support systems for research sponsors, integrating modern data
      engineering, visualization, and automation technologies.
    highlights:
      - "Led the creation of a mobile tracking system for USAID to monitor commodities in low-connectivity environments; successfully field tested the pilot in Texas for shipments to Africa, enabling reliable end-to-end supply chain visibility."
      - "Delivered a mobile prototype for humanitarian deconfliction notifications that enabled analysts to visualize no-strike zones and submit secure, auditable reports; the prototype contributed to a larger program that later received approximately $1M in follow-on funding."
      - "Built a counter–human-trafficking investigation tool for law enforcement that enabled investigators to triage large volumes of digital evidence and reduce time to actionable leads."
      - "Developed an externally accessible, map-based decision support tool that allowed sponsors and analysts to visualize and contextualize datasets from a shared data hub, supporting higher-level awareness of complex information such as crop calendars and regional trends."
      - "Contributed to NATO disaster-response exercises by extending field-ready mobile capabilities, including map-based hazard and area-of-interest features and real-time location reporting, ensuring reliable situational awareness across multinational operations."
      - "Proactively explored reproducible development environments to reduce friction in fast-paced research workflows, with the goal of enabling faster context switching between prototype projects and smoother onboarding into new problem spaces."

  - company: "Incompris LLC"
    location: "Independent"
    title: "Founder & Music Business Architect"
    dates: "2023 – Present"
